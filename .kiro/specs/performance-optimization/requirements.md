# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Performance Optimization feature focuses on enhancing the Card View Explorer plugin's performance when handling large note collections, optimizing memory usage, and ensuring smooth user interactions. This feature addresses scalability concerns and provides monitoring capabilities for performance analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user with a large vault, I want the Card View Explorer to perform well with thousands of notes, so that the interface remains responsive and usable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying large numbers of cards (1000+ notes) THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling performance
2. WHEN loading note collections THEN the system SHALL implement efficient virtual scrolling using react-virtuoso
3. WHEN processing note metadata THEN the system SHALL use optimized data structures and algorithms
4. WHEN filtering large datasets THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-100ms response times for filter operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want the Card View Explorer to use memory efficiently, so that it doesn't impact Obsidian's overall performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading note data THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading for note content
2. WHEN displaying cards THEN the system SHALL only render visible items in the viewport
3. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL implement memory-efficient data structures
4. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection optimization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want real-time updates to be efficient, so that the interface doesn't lag when notes are modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vault events occur THEN the system SHALL implement debounced update mechanisms
2. WHEN metadata changes THEN the system SHALL update only affected notes rather than reprocessing all data
3. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL use incremental filtering for better performance
4. WHEN sorting changes THEN the system SHALL implement efficient sorting algorithms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer or power user, I want performance monitoring capabilities, so that I can understand and optimize the plugin's performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL track memory usage metrics
2. WHEN operations are performed THEN the system SHALL measure and log operation timing
3. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN the system SHALL provide performance analytics
4. WHEN debugging performance issues THEN the system SHALL offer detailed performance profiling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want the Card View Explorer to handle edge cases gracefully, so that performance doesn't degrade under unusual conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering very large notes THEN the system SHALL implement content truncation strategies
2. WHEN processing corrupted or invalid data THEN the system SHALL handle errors without performance impact
3. WHEN memory limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation
4. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN the system SHALL manage resource contention effectively
