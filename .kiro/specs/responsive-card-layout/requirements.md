# Requirements Specification

## Overview
This feature extends the Card Explorer plugin's user interface to a more flexible and responsive design. It changes the current single-card-per-row layout to a responsive grid layout (up to 5 cards per row) and makes the filter panel placement and main card area display location configurable, accommodating various screen sizes and usage patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Responsive Card Grid Layout
**User Story:** As a Card Explorer user, I want multiple cards to be displayed per row based on screen width so that I can view more notes at once and browse them efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN screen width is 1200px or above THEN up to 5 cards are displayed per row
2. WHEN screen width is 768px-1200px THEN 3-4 cards are displayed per row
3. WHEN screen width is less than 768px THEN 1-2 cards are displayed per row
4. WHEN cards are displayed in grid layout THEN all cards are shown with uniform size
5. WHEN layout changes THEN spacing between cards is maintained consistently
6. WHEN grid layout is applied THEN virtual scroll performance is maintained
7. IF screen size changes THEN layout transitions smoothly

### Requirement 2: Filter Panel Right Sidebar Placement
**User Story:** As a Card Explorer user, I want the filter panel to be placed in the right sidebar so that I can maximize the card display space in the main area while keeping filter settings constantly accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN Card Explorer is opened THEN the filter panel is displayed in the right sidebar area
2. WHEN the filter panel is placed in the right sidebar THEN all existing filter features are available
3. WHEN the filter panel is displayed in the right sidebar THEN it integrates properly with Obsidian's sidebar system
4. WHEN filter conditions are changed THEN the card list is updated in real-time
5. WHEN the right sidebar is narrow THEN filter controls adapt responsively
6. IF the filter panel is inaccessible THEN an appropriate error message is displayed

### Requirement 3: Main Area Display Mode Setting
**User Story:** As a Card Explorer user, I want to choose whether to display the card list in the main area or right sidebar so that I can use the layout that best fits my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN plugin settings are opened THEN "Main Area Mode" and "Sidebar Mode" selection options are displayed
2. WHEN "Main Area Mode" is selected THEN the card list is displayed in the main workspace area
3. WHEN "Sidebar Mode" is selected THEN the card list is displayed in the right sidebar area
4. WHEN display mode is changed THEN settings are immediately applied and persisted
5. WHEN in "Main Area Mode" THEN the filter panel is displayed independently in the right sidebar
6. WHEN in "Sidebar Mode" THEN the filter panel is displayed above the card list
7. IF an error occurs during layout change THEN it automatically reverts to the previous setting

### Requirement 4: Sidebar Mode Exclusive Features
**User Story:** As a Card Explorer user, I want the filter panel to be collapsible in sidebar mode to efficiently utilize limited space and maximize the card display area.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN sidebar mode is selected THEN collapse/expand buttons are displayed on the filter panel
2. WHEN the filter panel is collapsed THEN the card list display space is expanded
3. WHEN the filter panel is expanded THEN all filter controls become accessible
4. WHEN the filter panel state is changed THEN the state is retained until the next startup
5. WHEN the filter panel is collapsed THEN a summary of active filters is displayed
6. WHEN filters are applied THEN the filter state is visually recognizable even when collapsed
7. IF sidebar space is insufficient THEN it automatically switches to compact display

### Requirement 5: Layout Settings Persistence
**User Story:** As a Card Explorer user, I want my selected layout settings and filter panel state to be saved so that I can start with my preferred configuration the next time I use it.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN layout mode is changed THEN settings are automatically saved to plugin data
2. WHEN filter panel collapse state is changed THEN the state is persisted
3. WHEN Obsidian is restarted THEN previous settings are restored
4. WHEN settings save fails THEN a clear error message is displayed to the user
5. WHEN corrupted settings data is detected THEN it automatically recovers to default settings
6. WHEN data migration is needed THEN existing settings are properly migrated
7. IF settings loading fails THEN fallback values are used and errors are logged

### Requirement 6: Virtual Scroll and Performance Maintenance
**User Story:** As a Card Explorer user, I want the existing high-performance virtual scroll functionality to be maintained even in grid layout so that I can operate smoothly with large numbers of notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN grid layout is applied THEN react-virtuoso virtual scroll functions properly
2. WHEN 1000+ notes are displayed THEN scroll performance is maintained at 60FPS or higher
3. WHEN layout is changed THEN virtual scroll position is properly preserved
4. WHEN card sizes are uniform THEN virtual scroll height calculation is performed accurately
5. WHEN screen size changes THEN virtual scroll is appropriately recalculated
6. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN memory efficiency is maintained even in grid layout
7. IF virtual scroll encounters an error THEN it falls back to normal scrolling

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing Features
**User Story:** As a Card Explorer user, I want existing features like pin functionality, sort functionality, and filtering functionality to continue working properly even when new layout features are introduced, so that I can maintain my familiar workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN grid layout is displayed THEN pinned cards are correctly displayed at the top
2. WHEN sort settings are changed THEN card order within the grid is properly updated
3. WHEN filters are applied THEN grid layout is correctly filtered
4. WHEN a card is clicked THEN the corresponding note is properly opened
5. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN grid layout is correctly updated
6. WHEN errors occur THEN existing error handling functionality works properly
7. IF problems occur with existing features THEN layout switches to fallback display
